      ## Checklist
      ### Ensure that your:
      - plugin is in a GitHub repository
      - repository name/plugin name is not already existing in [Duet3D Plugin Repository](https://github.com/Duet3D/PluginRepository/tree/master/src/plugins)
      - markdown files are renamed (case-sensitive) as PLUGIN.md, README.md
      - Check the content in markdown files against [an online md viewer](https://markdownlivepreview.com/) as sometimes, images might not be displayed correctly
      - If the images are not shown, use the url format `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<username>/<repo name>/<branch>/<path>/<img name> `
      - plugin manifest file is renamed (case-sensitive) as `plugin.json` 
      - plugin manifest file size is below 16KB
      - plugin has at least one release
      - plugin zip can be downloaded as a zip file via [GitHub Releases](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository)
      Otherwise the checks will not pass.

      ### Plugin Manifest (`plugin.json`)
      `plugin.json` : This file holds general information about the plugin. See the [DSF Wiki](https://github.com/Duet3D/DuetSoftwareFramework/wiki/Third-Party-Plugins#plugin-manifest) for further details. Some elements will need to be changed accordingly depending on whether it is for `DWC`, `SBC`, `RRF`.

      ### Zip file structure:
      Zip file structure can be found from [DSF Wiki](https://github.com/Duet3D/DuetSoftwareFramework/wiki/Third-Party-Plugins#zip-file-structure) and is meant to provide a general idea. Some elements will need to be changed accordingly depending on whether it is for `DWC`, `SBC`, `RRF`.
